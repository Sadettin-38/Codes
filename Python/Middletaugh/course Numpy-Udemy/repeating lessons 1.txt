import matplotlib.pyplot,numpy and pandas and dont forget to  show each step on the graph by calling show() function
graph 1,2,3 for x axis and 2,4,6 for y axis using plot() function
set the title
set up labels' names
examine fontdict that is inside the function "title"
try to show integer values  on the ticks.
show legend but set up label as 2x first.
try to change the colour,marker,markersize, markeredge color,  linestyle,linewidth of the line
search for short hand notation like 'b^--' indide  the plot()
print x2 and x2 is np.arange(0,4.5,0.5)
plot the graph of x2 to x2**2
make the graph due to x2 as line graph till x=2 and dash graph from x=2
resize the graph figure()
we want to save our graph into to internal storage
use comments to summaries of each steps
show it with show()


now bar chart
make  labels and values definitions like A,B,C and 1,4,2 into the lists
show the bar(plt.bar(list1,list2))
set the figsize
set the hatches .set_hatch('/') 
also make hatches by using for loop """bar.set_hatches(patterns.pop())"""
show()
