make a random data with randn by 100*2
make a scatter by choosing two coloumn that are first and second one. plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1])
and print


to different colors generate some random data 200*2 named X
increase first 50 coloumns elements by 3
Make a zeros coloumn by 200 named Y
equalize first 50 coloumns with 1  Y[:50]=1
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1],c=Y)
And see
