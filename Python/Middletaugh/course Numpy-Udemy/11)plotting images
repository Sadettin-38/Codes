read and show images commands

imread-imshow

use Image.open('im name') to address the image

then use type() to call its type

store the image as an array by using numpy

code arr.shape

plot the image by  using plt.imshow(arr)

make the image into black and white using grey=arr.mean(axis=2)
because we want to make the image into b and w but...

check the shape

plot the image with imshow and see what matplotlib colors the image! it is not grey(b and w)

we should fix it using cmap inside the function plt.imshow(..., cmap=...)
